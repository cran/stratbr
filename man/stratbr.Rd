\description{
This function aims at constructing optimal strata with an optimization algorithm
based on a global optimisation technique called Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithms(BRKGA).
The optimization algorithm is applied to solve the one dimensional case,
which reduces the stratification problem to just determining strata boundaries.
Assuming that the number H of strata and the total sample size n are fixed,
it is possible to produce the strata boundaries by taking into consideration
an objective function associated with the variance.
This function determines strata boundaries so that the elements in each
stratum are more homogeneous among themselves.
